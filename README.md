Retro Multi-player Web-based Dungeon Crawler Game:
Working with a team of 3 people:

Our dungeon will be a series of interconnecting rooms. Each team will build one room. 
The room will have a single challenge in it. Players will use up or gain manna and gold pieces. 
Every room will have four exits that each lead to another team's room. Given that we have about 
300 students we could have upwards to 100 or more rooms. 
The player dies when their manna goes to zero. The player wins when they collect 100 gold pieces.
